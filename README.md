# KennyHoward.com

A modernization of my portoflio website was long overdue from my [previous portfolio site](https://github.com/kenhoward/kenny-howard). Thanks to [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the theme.

## For Future Me

1. Use the correct Node.js version
```
nvm use
```

4. Install dependencies (leverage sudo if necessary)
```
npm install
```

5. Start the development server
```
npm run dev
```
