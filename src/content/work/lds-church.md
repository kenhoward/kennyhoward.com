## LDS Church Billboard Tracker - Contract Work

During my time at **DevMountain**, I was selected to be part of a **5-person team** contracted to build a **billboard lease tracking dashboard** for **The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints**. Over the course of **one month**, we designed and delivered a **fully functional CRUD application** to meet the client's needs.

### **Project Overview**
The objective was to **create an internal dashboard** where administrators could:
- **Filter and search through active billboard leases**.
- **View lease details**, including cost, duration, and lessor.
- **See billboard locations on an interactive Google Map**.
- **Upload and manage billboard images** for easy reference.
- **Securely access the dashboard with OAuth 2.0 authentication**.

### **Technology Stack**
The project was developed using the **MEAN stack**, leveraging:
- **MongoDB** – Stored lease data, billboard details, and images.
- **Express.js & Node.js** – Provided backend services and API endpoints.
- **Angular** – Created a responsive and interactive front-end dashboard.
- **Google Maps API** – Integrated to visualize billboard locations.
- **Bootstrap** – Styled the UI for a clean and professional appearance.
- **OAuth 2.0** – Secured access to ensure only authorized users could modify data.

### **Challenges & Solutions**
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring **data accuracy and usability**. We needed to implement robust filtering options, so users could quickly find relevant lease details. Another key aspect was integrating **Google Maps API**, which required optimizing data retrieval to **prevent performance bottlenecks**.

This was one of my earliest experiences working in a **team-based contract environment**, and it provided valuable insights into **client expectations, full-stack development, and delivering a functional product on a deadline**. The lessons learned from this project influenced my future work, particularly in building **data-driven applications**.
