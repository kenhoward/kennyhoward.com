## Talia's Tiny Tots
### A Growing Daycare Platform

Taliaâ€™s Tiny Tots is an **in-home daycare** run by my wife, and I built this **temporary landing page** to serve as the business's online presence while planning a more **feature-rich platform** for the future.

### **Current Website**
The current website is a **simple, customized landing page** that includes:
- **Basic business information** for potential clients.
- **Quick links to social media and contact details.**
- **A professional and approachable design** using **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript**.

### **Future Plans & Functionality**
Beyond the current landing page, I am planning to develop a **full-fledged daycare management system** with:
- **Admin Portal**: A secure login for daycare staff to manage enrollment.
- **Availability Tracker**: A system for tracking openings based on child ages, end dates, and limited infant slots.
- **Parent Dashboard**: A way for parents to view real-time availability and updates.

This initial site was a **fast and efficient deployment**, but future iterations will expand upon it to provide a **scalable and functional platform** for daycare operations.
