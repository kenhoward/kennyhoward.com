## My Personal Business Card & Dev Playground

> “Sometimes the best way to learn is to break things.” – Me, probably.

This **Business Card** website is a **simple yet dynamic** personal page that acts as a **quick link hub** to my **main website, GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, email,** and more. While it serves as an easy way for people to connect with me, it also doubles as my **sandbox** for testing **new ideas, features, and experiments**.

### **Features & Fun Additions**
- **Quick Link Hub:** A single landing page to access all my professional and social links.  
- **Experimental Sandbox:** I regularly tweak, break, and rebuild parts of this site to test new front-end techniques.  
- **Self-Destruction Button:** Includes .wav sound effects from **Aliens (1986)** for a dramatic touch.  
- **Customized Styles & UI:** Fully built with **Astro, HTML, CSS**, and some JavaScript for interactive elements.

This project started as a simple **business card-style site** but has evolved into a **personal playground** where I can freely test **new approaches, animation techniques, UI enhancements, and more.** Future updates may include additional **dynamic elements, hidden easter eggs, and interactive features.**
