## Copper Mountain U13 Soccer Team Website  

> "Success is no accident" – Pelé

This **team website** was quickly created to provide **parents and players** with an easy way to access:
- **Game schedules**
- **Match records**
- **Team and player stats**

### **Why I Built This**
I developed this project because my son frequently asked for the **team schedule**, even after I had already shared it multiple times. Rather than resending screenshots, I decided to build a **centralized hub** where the schedule, scores, and stats could be accessed at any time.

### **Current Features**
- **Game schedule access for players and parents**  
- **Record tracking for past and upcoming matches**  
- **Basic player and team stats display**  

### **Future Enhancements**
I plan to expand this project into a **dynamic game-tracking platform** by integrating **Firebase** for real-time data management. The next phase will include:
- **Live score tracking during games**
- **Automated stat updates post-match**
- **Seamless data storage for historical records**

This project was a **quick but efficient build**, and I look forward to **enhancing it** into a **fully-featured team management tool** over time.
