## Auction Draft Tracker - Fantasy Football Draft Assistance

> “The road to Easy Street goes through the sewer” – John Madden

The **Auction Draft Tracker** was one of the first apps I built, and I was proud of how it was structured. It was originally developed to help me **track and manage my fantasy football draft targets**, ensuring I had an organized view of player selections and remaining budget in an auction-style draft.

While the initial version was built to serve my own needs, this tool laid the groundwork for an enhanced version that will be integrated into **[Garbage Time Fantasy](/work/garbage-time-fantasy)** in the future.

### **Project Overview**
Instead of **manually tracking** fantasy football picks on paper, I wanted a **dynamic solution** that could:
- **Display targeted players** and track selections in real time.
- **Manage budget calculations** based on selected players.
- **Provide draft recommendations** as selections progressed.

After **testing the initial build** in mock drafts, I quickly realized my approach had fundamental flaws. I had about **a week before my league’s actual draft**, so I pivoted, **refactored the logic**, and made the app **far more intuitive and effective** within that short timeframe. This was a major learning experience, reinforcing the **importance of testing and adaptability**.

### **Wireframing & UX Planning**
For all my projects, I start with **wireframes** to map out functionality and UI structure before diving into development. Below is the wireframe that closely represents the **final version of the app**.

### **Technology Stack**
- **AngularJS**: Built the interactive front-end with dynamic UI updates.
- **Express**: Served as the backend framework.
- **Bootstrap**: Provided a responsive UI foundation.
- **Gulp**: Automated build tasks and optimized performance.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles and layouts.

### **Future Integration into Garbage Time Fantasy**
This project provided **valuable insights into draft optimization**, and its core functionalities will be expanded and refined in **Garbage Time Fantasy**. The next iteration will:
- Include **real-time draft suggestions** based on previously selected players.
- Offer **enhanced analytics** for player recommendations.
- Support **team-building strategies** throughout the draft.
