## A Decade of Innovation at Beyond, Inc.

I have been a part of **Beyond, Inc.** (formerly **Overstock.com**) for nearly a decade, playing a pivotal role in maintaining, optimizing, and modernizing the front-end architecture of one of the leading e-commerce platforms in the industry. Over the years, I have had the privilege of working on multiple key teams, including **Homepage, Header & Footer, and Search & Navigation**, each contributing significantly to my technical expertise.

Beyond, Inc. has always been a company that embraces **cutting-edge technology**, and I take immense pride in contributing to that culture of continuous innovation. From transitioning away from jQuery in 2016 to **migrating Overstock.com to Shopify** in 2023, my time here has been a journey of learning, problem-solving, and pushing boundaries.

## **Key Contributions**

### **1. Front-End Modernization & Search Enhancements**
One of my earliest contributions at Beyond, Inc. was **migrating our codebase from jQuery and Handlebars to React** back in 2016. This was a major turning point, enabling faster development cycles, reusable components, and a more scalable front-end architecture.

Above is a **screenshot of a search page** on our website that includes the **header**. **Every element seen in this screenshot is something that I have directly worked on, helped build, and continue to maintain.** From the search functionality to the dynamic UI components, this page represents countless hours of development, optimizations, and A/B testing.

#### **Notable Work:**
- **Search Migration:** Transitioned our search from Apache SOLR to **Google Retail Search (GRS)**, ensuring improved speed and accuracy for customer queries.
- **Sitewide A/B Testing:** Worked on **hundreds of experiments** to optimize user experience, conversion rates, and UI interactions.
- **ADA Compliance:** Ensured accessibility best practices across our applications.
- **Performance & Observability:** Managed sitewide **Web Vitals optimizations**, application **stress testing**, and implemented **SLOs (Service Level Objectives)** for **Header, Footer, and Search** as a whole.
- **Search App Migration:** Led the transition of our Search application from a **legacy framework to Next.js**, modernizing its architecture for improved performance, scalability, and developer experience.

### **2. Shopify Migration & Contributions to Backyard.com**  
In June 2023, Beyond, Inc. acquired the **Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)** brand, merging it with our existing **Overstock.com** infrastructure. As part of this transition, I played a key role in the **migration of Overstock.com to Shopify**, ensuring a smooth transition while maintaining performance and functionality.

#### **Key Contributions:**  
- **Core Deployment & Fast Follows:** Assisted with the initial Shopify launch, debugging critical UI components and implementing quick iterations.  
- **Collaboration with Leadership:** Worked closely with the **Chief Product Officer** to ensure the migration aligned with business goals.  
- **Custom Shopify Enhancements:** Helped adapt our **existing architecture** to Shopify while optimizing for speed and usability.  

Beyond the Shopify migration, I also contributed to **Beyond’s Backyard.com brand**, assisting with **front-end improvements and optimizations** to enhance the user experience.

### **3. Internal Tools & Platform Enhancements**
Beyond just customer-facing work, I have also been heavily involved in building and maintaining **internal tools** to support our teams.

#### **Notable Internal Contributions:**
- **Company-Wide Component Library:** Contributed to our **reusable UI component system**, ensuring consistency across all teams.
- **Deals Tag Logic:** Developed and maintained **promotional tag logic**, ensuring correct pricing visibility for discounts and sales.
- **Registries Implementation:** Integrated the **registry system** into the Bed Bath & Beyond ecosystem.
- **Notification Center:** Designed and implemented a **centralized user notification system**.

## **Technologies & Skills Acquired**
Much of my technical expertise stems from my experiences at Beyond, Inc. Some of the **key technologies** I have worked with extensively include:

- **Front-End:** React, Redux, Context API, TypeScript, Next.js, Webpack, Bootstrap, Sass, Tailwind CSS.
- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express, Fastify, PostgreSQL.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Testing & Monitoring:** A/B Testing, Stress Testing, Web Vitals Optimization, SLOs, Observability.

Beyond the tools themselves, I have learned **how to architect scalable applications**, work collaboratively across teams, and balance rapid innovation with system stability.
