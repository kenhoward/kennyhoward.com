## Twerk Talia - Dance Fitness Branding & Web Presence

> “I aim to create an inclusive, body-empowering space for everyone through twerking and dance fitness” – Natalia Howard

Twerk Talia is a **dance fitness brand** founded by my wife, and I had the opportunity to help shape its **digital presence** by developing a **landing page** and customizing the **Vimeo OTT platform** to match her branding.

### What I Built:
- **Landing Page (twerktalia.com):**  
  A **quickly deployed**, fully customized website acting as a digital business card. The page contains her **social links, contact info**, and will soon expand to include **schedules, playlists, merch, and events.**
- **Vimeo OTT UI Customization:**  
  Customized the styling of **Vimeo OTT’s internal CMS** using **CSS overrides** to create a **branded user experience** for her subscribers.

This project was a fast and efficient setup, allowing **her brand to launch with a cohesive online presence** in just a few hours. Future iterations will expand upon this foundation.
